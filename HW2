<p>When it comes to Trello, I do not believe I have ever used this platform before and I am a little confused. If I am understanding this correctly, There will be 
two teams and each team will have one of the projects from the trello board. Off of a quick glance I would say I am more interested in teh Food Events board.</p>
<p> So my first question is: Is the "backlog" the section where all the tasks are and individuals will be asigned tasks that are from there? Are the tasks movable? 
Do you slide them across the board as they are worked on and are closer to being completed?</p>
<p> My next question is: Are our final products going to be used in real life? If they are done well and completely will someone actually get to use them?</p>
