<h1>Helen Ann Stone</h1>
<p>hello</p>
<p>After reading Chapter 1, I would like to reflect upon the first section. The first section is titled "My cat ate my source code." This section stuck with me because sometimes I have a hard time owning my work and taking responsibility for my struggles when it comes to coding. I find coding very difficult and confusing and I usually want to give up and not keep trying. This section tells me I need to take a step back and analyze where my problems are coming from and how I can go about solving my problems when it comes to my projects. It says, "Provide options, don't make lame excuses." </p>
